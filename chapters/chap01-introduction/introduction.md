## Why Study Category Theory?

When we define the adjoint to a functor, we get a new functor (a parameterized
data type), a natural transformation (a function) and a bijection between
hom-sets (another function.) Thus, an adjoint definition corresponds to a
module in a programming language rather than a single function definition, but
it is a module which has some internal cohesion.

Category theory is also largely constructive. Theorems asserting the existence
of objects are proven by explicit constructions, which means we can view
category theory as a collection of algorithms. These algorithms are general in
the sense that they are parameterized over an arbitrary category and so can be
specialized to different data structures.
