# Computational Category Theory

These notes and code are based on the book *Computational Category Theory* by
D.E. Rydeheard and R.M. Burstall. The book is an account of a project wherein
basic constructions of category theory are expressed as computer programs. The
programs in these notes are composed in SML(NJ). These programs are, further,
used to develop algorithms for the unification of terms and to implement a
categorical semantics.
